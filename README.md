Exploring Accessibility Reporting with DAP and Pa11y:

At Instructure, we have a company tradition called _Dim the Lights_, which allows us to recharge or work on side projects. Last year, I used this time to brainstorm an out-of-the-box use case for our **Data Access Platform (DAP)**.

Initially, I considered experimenting with linear regression models, but my attention shifted to some of the common comments Iâ€™d heard about accessibility reporting in Canvas. My first instinct was to scrape data from my Canvas instance, but that approach didnâ€™t feel right. Fortunately, DAP includes the **wiki pages table**, which already contains the HTML values of pagesâ€”no scraping required!

  **Step 1: Identifying Accessibility Issues**

With the data in hand, the next step was to identify accessibility issues within the pages. I started by looking into the accessibility tool built into Canvas, but I felt there was room for more depth. Enter trusty Google! After dodging bland AI-generated responses (please bring back the old Google ðŸ˜…), I stumbled upon [Pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y).

**Pa11y** is a CLI tool that automates accessibility testing for HTML pages. By default, it adheres to WCAG 2.1 Level AAA standardsâ€”exactly the level of rigor I wanted. Time to get to work.

  **Step 2: Preparing the Data**

To keep things simple for this proof of concept, I selected a Canvas instance with limited data. I synchronized the DAP tables to my Postgres instance and wrote a quick SQL query to produce a CSV file containing the following columns: page ID, page title, course ID, teacher name, and body content. Once I had the CSV file, I was ready to dig into **Pa11y**.

  **Step 3: Running Accessibility Tests**

At first, I tried passing HTML values directly to Pa11y, but I quickly realized that it requires actual HTML files. After a bit of trial and error, I put together this Python script to process the CSV, generate HTML files, and run Pa11y tests. With this script, I was able to generate a report of all the accessibility issues! ðŸŽ‰

**Step 4: Visualizing the Results**

While a CSV full of accessibility issues is functional, itâ€™s not exactly user-friendly. To make the results more digestible, I turned to **Looker Studio** to create a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/70da3b25-51b8-461b-876b-a2405bde8a33).

  

  

Itâ€™s not the prettiest dashboard Iâ€™ve ever built, but it works as a proof of concept!

  

**Reflection and Next Steps**

Looking back, hereâ€™s how this process could be improved for scalability:

â€¢ **Switch to JavaScript:** Implementing this in JavaScript would eliminate the need for Pythonâ€™s subprocess calls.

â€¢ **Direct Integration:** Save the report to a Postgres table for direct integration with a dashboard builder.

â€¢ **Smarter Updates:** Use the _revision_ column in the wiki pages table to check if a page has been updated since the last report, reducing unnecessary HTML generation.

â€¢ **Instructor Notifications:** Leverage Pa11yâ€™s recommendations to notify instructors of accessibility issues directly.
